# Building Abstractions with Procedures

_Computational process_ manipulates data.

_Programm_ — pattern of rules. Program direct processes.

_Interpreter_ carries out processes that were written in specific language.

## Elements of programming

Languages contain:
- primitive expressions
- means of combination
- means of abstraction

These are used for data and procedures.

### Expressions

Combinations: operator and operands. Prefix notation. Nested combinations.

_Read-eval-print_ loop of interpreter.

### Naming and Environment

_Name_ identifies a _variable_, which stores object's _value_. Languages provide names to refer to objects.

Names are used to abstract and build objects of increasing complexity. In Scheme: `define`.

_Environment_ of interpreter is memory keeping track of name-object pairs.
