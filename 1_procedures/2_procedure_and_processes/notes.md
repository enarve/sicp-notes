## Procedures and the processes they generate

Visualizing the processes generated by various types of procedures. Procedure as a pattern for the _local evolution_ of a computational process. _Global_ behavior of a process.

### Linear recursion and iteration

`n! = n * (n-1) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1` — factorial.
`n! = n * (n-1)!`

Shapes of procedures.

Expansion followed by contraction, chain of _deferred operations_. _Recursive process_ is characterized by chain of _deferred operations_. Interpreter keeps track of operations to be performed later on. In `n!` — linear growth, `n` operations to remember. _Linear recursive process_.

_Iterative process_. Keeping track of _state variables_. Fixed rule to describe how states must be updated step to step. in `n!` — `n` steps, _linear iterative process_.

Recursive procedure — procedure that refers to itself. Not the same as recursive process, which describes process evolution, not syntactical definition.

Special-purpose _looping constructs_. _Tail-recursive_ implementation of language: keeping iterative process in constant (number of state varibles) space (memory).
